Patient Management System
An intuitive React-based web application designed to manage patient records efficiently, offering features such as editable patient profiles and a modular architecture for scalability.

🚀 Getting Started
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

npm start
Runs the application in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page reloads automatically if you make edits.
You will also see lint errors in the console.
npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

For more details, see the running tests documentation.

npm run build
Builds the app for production into the build folder.

React is bundled in production mode and optimized for the best performance.
The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes for caching.
Your app will be ready to deploy after this step.

For more information, check the deployment documentation.

npm run eject
Warning: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t revert!

Ejecting gives you full control over the app’s configuration (e.g., Webpack, Babel).

Use this command only if you need to customize the build tools or configurations beyond the default setup.
